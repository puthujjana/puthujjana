## Summary

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11sLSMDCoAS_NophNBSfATYkiDUyIzHm5JvAuowbUpOg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Google Sheet</a> contains a developing bibliography of publications on the topic of Nibbāna. The primary focus is English academic literature on the topic of Nibbāna in Early Buddhism; nonetheless, non-academic (e.g., Buddhist forums) and later Buddhist materials (e.g., Tibetan views) and alternative formats (e.g., interviews) will be included wherever available to create the most comprehensive and exhaustive bibliography as possible. The intention behind this bibliography is that it serves as a field guide for those new to the topic, and a convenient reference for those with experience. Then again, it might also reveal new articles to those with experience that they failed to come across prior.

The purpose of this list would be to offer a convenient reference for those interested in the topic, both new and seasoned. Moreover, it is hoped that such a list, along with further annotation, can be used to gauge the Canonical evidence cumulatively, in order to discern the most faithful doctrine of Nibbāna. In it's current form, it is very incomplete. Hopefully much of the relevant suttas have been listed by the end of 2025.
