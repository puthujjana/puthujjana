## Summary

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11sLSMDCoAS_NophNBSfATYkiDUyIzHm5JvAuowbUpOg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Google Sheet</a> contains a developing bibliography of publications on the topic of Nibbāna. The primary focus is English academic literature on the topic of Nibbāna in Early Buddhism; nonetheless, non-academic (e.g., Buddhist forums) and later Buddhist materials (e.g., Vajrayāna views) and alternative formats (e.g., interviews) will be included wherever available to create the most comprehensive and exhaustive bibliography as possible.
