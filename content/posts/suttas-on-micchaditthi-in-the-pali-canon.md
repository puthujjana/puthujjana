title = 'Suttas on Micchādiṭṭhi in the Pali Canon'
+++

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cWQ3HX3xQ2UbxeVxmcQ4xKGs4XfMVrHP-BkVURKNINs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Google Sheet</a> contains a developing list of suttas on the subjet of micchādiṭṭhi (wrong view) in the Pāli Canon. It is not yet exhaustive, though in its present state it should at least contain a substantial enough body of suttas by which to determine various questions on the subject of micchādiṭṭhi. What is wrong view? What are some examples? How should a good Buddhist repond to wrong view? The intention of this list is that it serves as a basis to discern not just a clear doctrine or standard of wrong view, but a clear standard of how a disciple and the Saṇgha ought to respond to wrong view.
