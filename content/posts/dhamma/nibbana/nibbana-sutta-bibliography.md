## Introduction
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQCSdpW_KRClv0_2rN6tgf3gHWRqT-dvxg2GPU0YaYM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Google Sheet</a> contains a developing list of suttas in the Pāli Canon integral to understanding Nibbāna and related questions. The purpose of this list would be to offer a convenient reference for those interested in the topic, both new and seasoned. Moreover, it is hoped that such a list, along with further annotation, can be used to gauge the Canonical evidence cumulatively, in order to discern the most faithful doctrine of Nibbāna. In it's current form, it is very incomplete. Hopefully much of the relevant suttas have been listed by the end of 2025.

## Structure
Evidently, the spreadsheet is currently not well-organized, as it becomes clearer what is the most fluid and useful way to do so. Currently, it is intended to be divided into different tabs for each major topic weighing on the question of Nibbāna—e.g., consciousness, anattā, etc.—and then each line-item further organized according to major sub-topics—e.g., in the case of consciousness, viññāṇaṃ anidassanṃ, appatiṭṭha viññāṇa, etc. 

## Purpose
This spreadsheet was originally designed for the author's use as a reference and a repository of all relevant suttas on the question of Nibbāna, in the attempt to discern accurately what is the correct doctrine of Nibbāna, according to the suttas, and the Buddha. And, of course, because no such reference has been made available, to the author's knowledge. 

## Shortcomings
At this stage, this project has been undertaken on the side, while it deserves fulltime treatment. Thus, it is developing slowly, and will expectedly not include, at least for the time being, those niche yet key passages which are typically only found through extensive and dedicated research.
