## Summary

<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1reE1QT2t-gYXYUhJKZw-Ds0GBRI_2Z4_/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> is a developing Anki deck for Pāli conjugations: that is to say, it contains cards with the different endings for different verb conjugations, such as the aorist, future tense, conditional, etc.. It probably contains some errors.


## Structure

Most cards are basic (not reversible). The front sides are mostly of the following form: 

>How is the [voice] [person] [number] [mood/tense] formed? 

For instance:
>How is the active first person singular optative formed?. 

The back sides are mostly of the following form: 

>(1) [termination]
>
>(2) [termination]
>
>...

For instance, regarding the previous example: 
> (1) -eyyāmi (2) eyyaṃ (3) e (<i>4) ehaṃ (5) eyyahaṃ (6) eyyāhaṃ</i>)

## How to Use the Deck

The deck contains conjugations for the active and middle voices. It is suggested that beginners give little attention to or avoid altogether the middle voice conjugations, as the middle voice is an infrequent and mostly deprecated form. Moreover, it is suggested that the new student mostly ignore the italicized (rare) conjugations, and focus on proficiency in the fewer core conjugations needed to read most Pāli texts. The deck is intended as a <i>supplement</i> to one's Pāli studies, not as primary material, so it is suggested that it be given a fraction of one's time to study Pāli.

## Shortcomings

The deck is intended to contain every conjugation that appears in the Pāli language, canonical, commentarial, or otherwise. Thus, it does include forms that are quite rare and that even intermediate and advanced students need not know. Then again, where possible, such forms have been grouped and italicized, so that the student may choose to ignore them or at least pay them little mind.

That being said, the author of this deck is not a Pāli scholar, and so their may be missing forms, or mistaken forms, or some rare forms that aren't italicized, and some common ones that are, among other kinds of possible errors; so, users are cautioned to do their research. It goes without saying, but all errors are the responsibility of the author.

## Materials Used

The primary materials used were the tables provided at the end of the excellent grammar <i>Magadhabhasa (Pāḷi) - A Compendious Grammar on the Language of Pāḷi Buddhism</i>
