<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FfUONaYSVEj9oYc4S_BmH4CjWHOREZFVUisJUqkX5Mo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Google Doc</a> contains a developing summary or conceptual map of an article written by Alex Malpass and Wes Morriston entitled "Endless and Infinite". In itself, "The Concise Endless and Infinite" introduces nothing new to the discussion, other than a streamlined and convenient map and reference. This is part of a broader project to develop a conceptual map for the broader literature on arguments for the impossibility of actual infinites in defense of the kalƒÅm cosmological argument.
