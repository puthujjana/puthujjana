[{"content":"Summary This Google Sheet contains a developing list of suttas in the Pāli Canon integral to understanding Nibbāna and related questions. The purpose of this list would be to offer a convenient reference for those interested in the topic, both new and seasoned. Moreover, it is hoped that such a list, along with further annotation, can be used to gauge the Canonical evidence cumulatively, in order to discern the most faithful doctrine of Nibbāna. In it\u0026rsquo;s current form, it is very incomplete. Hopefully much of the relevant suttas have been listed by the end of 2025.\nStructure Evidently, the spreadsheet is currently not well-organized, as it becomes clearer what is the most fluid and useful way to do so. Currently, it is intended to be divided into different tabs for each major topic weighing on the question of Nibbāna—e.g., consciousness, anattā, etc.—and then each line-item further organized according to major sub-topics—e.g., in the case of consciousness, viññāṇaṃ anidassanṃ, appatiṭṭha viññāṇa, etc.\nPurpose This spreadsheet was originally designed for the author\u0026rsquo;s use as a reference and a repository of all relevant suttas on the question of Nibbāna, in the attempt to discern accurately what is the correct doctrine of Nibbāna, according to the suttas, and the Buddha. And, of course, because no such reference has been made available, to the author\u0026rsquo;s knowledge.\nShortcomings At this stage, this project has been undertaken on the side, while it deserves fulltime treatment. Thus, it is developing slowly, and will expectedly not include, at least for the time being, those niche yet key passages which are typically only found through extensive and dedicated research.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/puthujjana/posts/dhamma/nibbana/nibbana-sutta-bibliography/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQCSdpW_KRClv0_2rN6tgf3gHWRqT-dvxg2GPU0YaYM/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eThis Google Sheet\u003c/a\u003e contains a developing list of suttas in the Pāli Canon integral to understanding Nibbāna and related questions.

It probably contains some errors.\nStructure Most cards are basic (not reversible). The front sides are mostly of the following form:\nHow is the [voice] [person] [number] [tense] formed?\n(e.g., How is the active first person singular optative formed?).\nThe back sides are mostly of the following form:\n[ending]\n(e.g., (1) -eyyāmi (2) eyyaṃ (3) e (4) ehaṃ (5) eyyahaṃ (6) eyyāhaṃ)\nHow to Use the Deck The deck contains conjugations for the active, passive, and middle voices. It is suggested the beginners give little attention to or avoid altogether the middle voice conjugations, as the middle voice is an infrequent and mostly deprecated form. Moreover, it is suggested that the new student mostly ignore the italicized (rare) conjugations, and focus on proficiency in the fewer core conjugations needed to read most Pāli texts. The deck is intended as a supplement to one\u0026rsquo;s Pāli studies, not as primary material, so it is suggested that it be given a fraction of one\u0026rsquo;s time to study Pāli.\nShortcomings The deck is intended to contain every conjugation that appears in the Pāli language, canonical, commentarial, or otherwise. Thus, it does include forms that are quite rare and that even intermediate and advanced students need not know. Then again, where possible, such forms have been grouped and italicized, so that the student may choose to ignore them or at least pay them little mind.\nThat being said, the author of this deck is not a Pāli scholar, and so their may be missing forms, or mistaken forms, or some rare forms that aren\u0026rsquo;t italicized, and some common ones that are, among other kinds of possible errors; so, users are cautioned to do their research. It goes without saying, but all errors are the responsibility of the author.\nMaterials Used The primary materials used were the tables provided at the end of the excellent grammar Magadhabhasa (Pāḷi) - A Compendious Grammar on the Language of Pāḷi Buddhism Magadhabhasa (Pāḷi) - A Compendious Grammar on the Language of Pāḷi Buddhism, and Bhante Ñāṇatusita\u0026rsquo;s tables.\nBibliography Bhikkhu, A.
